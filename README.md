# Code-an-AI-Sudoku-Solver-in-Python
Sudoku is an extremely popular logic and combinatorial math-based puzzle that millions attempt on a daily basis online and on paper. In this session, we will show you how to implement a Sudoku game in Python with an in-built automatic puzzle solver (using an ML backtracking algorithm to find and evaluate candidate solutions recursively) to add some AI to our effort. Our game will allow the users to enter the numbers into the grid interactively as per the rules, with a timer running for those who wish to get competitive.  

For the workshop, we’ll use the free PyCharm IDE for Python (from JetBrains), so be sure to install that in advance to follow along—the IDE makes development and debugging for Python much easier.  

Prerequisites: 
—Basic knowledge of Python 
—PyCharm IDE (www.jetbrains.com/pycharm)
